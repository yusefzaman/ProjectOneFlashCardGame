### **_Description_**

##### I am looking to code a memory flash game where the user will be shown on a grid pictures for a few seconds, and then it will go blank and the user will be asked to then click the boxes where the pictures were shown - this is a memory game to test to what level the user can remember where images were shown.

##### The game will have three levels, where the time for which the images are shown will remain the same but the size of the grid will change - going from a 3x3 to then 5x5 then a 7x7 grid.

##### The placement of the images will be done in a random manner where a random number generator will be used to select the index of the box on the grid, so in level 1 there will be three random numbers which will correspond to the boxes, level 2 there will be 5 and then in level 3 there will be 7.

---

### **_Getting Started_**

##### The user will be presented with a start screen where they can click start to play the game. in each level if the user is unable to get it correct, then there will be a 'retry' button - allowing them to do that level again where the code will again randomly select three indexes for images to be placed
